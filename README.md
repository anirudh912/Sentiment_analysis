Depending on the given text input, the NLKT library has functions to predict the mood/sentiment of the given text. Such an analysis can be useful in monitoring depression and tweets related to it to take necessary actions. On the other hand, the same code can be used for analysing customer reviews for a range of products to predict the public response to them.
